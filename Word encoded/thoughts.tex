Picture of board game with notecard.
Entitled ``Turn-based Strategy Game''
Card asks' ``What 6-letter word is this diagram asking?''
\begin{itemize}
\item Based off of ``Octile Board game'' Seen on BGG.
\item 6x3 grid? Could each letter be encoded in one across row?
\item Only 4 colored pieces: Red, Teal, Yellow, and Pink
\begin{itemize}
\item 5 Red, 5 Teal, 4 Yellow, 2 Pink
\end{itemize}
\item 6 pieces within the 12 center squares. Could these be the terminating signals?
\item Is there some form of warping across the paths
\begin{itemize}
\item Does each path that ends at a peg on border indicate that one should copy the board to there?
\item How long does this go for?
\end{itemize}
\item PIGPEN cypher from six pegs in center? Terminate at blank squares? Sum of path lengths is Letter?
\item Seems to be a slight typo in ``asking''. Could this be a clue?
\item Betamaze?
\end{itemize}
